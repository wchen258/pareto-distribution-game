# pareto-distribution-game
A fair totally random game that gives rise to Pareto distribution or Matthew principle

The top percentage gets most of the money, production, and whatsoever. This is refered as Matthew's principle, 80-20 rule, or Pareto Distribution.

Learning that just in a pure random game with each player initialized with identical state, but as the game continues, some players would take it all and some go busted ---- Pareto distribution emerges, curiously, I wrote a script to mimic this game.

Example as rules:
say 50 players enter the game, each with 100 coins in their pocket. And their will start to gamble with each other randomly with half probability win/lose a coin to the other player. Then repeat the process.
